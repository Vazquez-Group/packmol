# Water molecules below the lipids:
# The first three numbers are the minimum x, y, z coordinates for this
# molecules, the last three are maximum coordinates. The box defined
# here has 160 Angstrom sides in the x and y directions and a 20
# Angstrom side in the z direction. So the box will be 160x160x20.

# First lipid layer: the polar head is oriented to down to the water
# molecules. 140 lipids will be put inside a box of side 160 in the x and y
# directions and 30 in the z direction (30 is a little more than that
# length of the lipid). The atoms 130 and 87 of the pdb file of this
# lipid belong to the tail and will be constrained to be
# above the plane z = 26., and the aton 0, which is the polar head
# of the lipid will be constrained to be below the plane
# z = 1. Therefore, all the lipids will be oriented, with their polar
# heads pointing to the water box below.
